                    Your childhood teacher did not wrong you when they taught you that there 
                    should be three, or four, or five sentences in a paragraph. 
                    It is important to understand, however, that the aim in teaching this was 
                    not to impart a hard-and-fast rule of grammar, drawn from an 
                    authoritative-but-dusty book. The true aim of this strategy was to teach 
                    you that your ideas must be well supported to be persuasive and effective

                    The model regarding paragraph length that your teacher undoubtedly taught 
                    you involves a topic sentence, a number of facts that support that core idea,
                    and a concluding sentence. The proviso about the number of sentences between
                    the topic sentence and the conclusion was not given to you because it was the 
                    magic formula for creating paragraphs of the perfect length; rather, your 
                    educator was attempting to give you a good reason to do adequate research
                    on your topic. Academic writing yields the best examples of the 
                    topic-support-conclusion paragraph structure.
